<p>This project is for educational purposes only!</p>
<p>This open-source Python standalone application downloads YouTube metadata (such as views and tags) using YtDlp and trains a model (using various training methods) based on the downloaded data. However, instead of using the generated model for prediction, it takes the output model weights and ranks them based on their impact on video views.</p>
<p>This is not a perfect method, as it assumes that tags are the only factor affecting views, which is not always true. Therefore, it may not always be a reliable source of knowledge and should be treated as a starting point for further investigation by specialists.</p>

<p>The data downloaded from YouTube depends on the input provided in the "search" field. It scans all channels relevant to the topic and downloads all of their videos.</p>
<p>Creating a new model takes a significant amount of time, typically several hours.</p>
<p>AI Tags supports parallel CPU computing with Cross-Validation using the Leave-One-Out method.</p>
